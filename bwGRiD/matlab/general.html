<h2>Accessing and basic usage</h2> 
  <p>In order to check which MATLAB versions are available on the cluster, run the following command 
   in the opened cluster terminal: 
   <pre>$ module avail math/matlab></pre>
  </p>
  <p>Typically several MATLAB versions are available.</p>
  <p>To load the appropriate version (if available), run:
   <pre>$ module load math/matlab/&ltversion&gt</pre>
   where <kbd>&ltversion&gt</kbd> is the desired available MATLAB version to load.
  </p>
  <p>An interactive MATLAB session with graphical user interface (GUI) can be started with 
   the command (requires X11 forwarding enabled for your ssh login):
   <pre>$ matlab</pre>
  </p>
  <p>Since graphic rendering can be very slow on remote connections, the preferable way to run MATLAB
   on the cluster is without GUI, with the following command:
   <pre>$ matlab -nodisplay</pre>
  </p>
  <p>In general it is not advisable to invoke an interactive MATLAB session on a login node of the cluster.
   The recommended way to run a long-duration interactive MATLAB session is to submit an interactive job
   and start MATLAB from within the dedicated compute node, assigned by the queueing system. As described
   in the <a href="../index.html#jobsHandle">cluster job submission</a> guide.
  </p>
  The following command will execute a MATLAB script on a single thread:
  <pre>$ matlab -nodisplay -singleCompThread -r script &gtresult.out 2&gt&1</pre>
  </p>
  <p>The output of this session will be redirected to the <kbd>result.out</kbd> file. The 
   <kbd>-singleCompThread</kbd> option prevents the creation of multiple threads. Most of the time,
   running MATLAB in single threaded mode (as described above) will meet your needs. But if you
   mathematically intense computations that might benefit from the built-in multi-threading provided
   by MATLAB's BLAS and FFT implementation, then you may experiment running in multi-threaded mode,
   by omitting the <kbd>-singleCompThread</kbd> option. (see <a href="#implicitThread">below</a> how to
   control the number of threads)
  </p>
  <p>As with all the processes that require more than a few minutes to run, non-trivial MATLAB jobs must be
   submitted to the cluster's queuing system.
  </p>
  <p>Batch scripts examples are available in the directory pointed to by the environment variable
   <kbd>$MATLAB_EXA_DIR</kbd>, after having the module loaded.
  </p>
  <p>The help page of the MATLAB module may provide more version specific information:
   <pre>$ module help math/matlab/&ltversion&gt</pre>

<h2>Parallel Computing with MATLAB</h2>
<h3 id="implicitThread">Implicit Threading</h3>
  <p>A large number of built-in MATLAB functions may utilize multiple cores automatically, without any
   code modifications required. This is referred as implicit multi threading and must be strictly 
   distinguished from explicit parallelism provided by the Parallel Computing Toolbox (PCT) which
   requires specific commands in your code to create threads.
  </p> 
  <p>Implicit threading, particularly takes place for linear algebra operations (such as the solution
   to a linear system <kbd>A\b</kbd> or matrix products <kbd>A*B</kbd>) and FFT operations. Many other
   high-level MATLAB functions do also benefit from multi threading capabilities of their underlying 
   routines. However, the user can still enforce single threaded mode by adding <kbd>-singleCompThread</kbd>
   command line option.
  </p>
  <p>Whenever implicit threading takes place, MATLAB will detect the total number of cores that exist on a 
   machine and by default uses <strong>all of them</strong>. This has very important implications for MATLAB
   jobs in HPC environments with shared-node job scheduling policy (i.e. with multiple users sharing one 
   compute node). Due to the behaviour described above, a MATLAB job may take over more compute resources 
   than assigned by the queueing system of the cluster (and thereby taking away these resources from all
   other users having jobs running on the same node - including your own jobs).
  </p>
  <p>Therefore, when running multi-threaded mode, MATLAB always requires the user's intervention to 
   <strong>not</strong> allocate all cores of the machine (unless requested so from the queueing system).
   The number of threads must be controlled from within the code by means of the <kbd>maxNumCompThreads(N)</kbd>
   function (which is supposed to be deprecated) or, alternatively, with the <kbd>feature('numThreads', N)</kbd>
   function.
  </p>
