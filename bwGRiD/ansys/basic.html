<h1>ANSYS on bwGRiD Cluster, Esslingen</h1>
  <h2>Accessing and basic usage</h2>
    <p>To view which ANSYS modules are available to use on the cluster,
      run the following command:
      <pre>$ module avail cae/ansys</pre> 
    </p>
    <p>To load the appropriate version (if available), run:
      <pre>$ module load cae/ansys/&ltversion&gt</pre>
      where <kbd>&ltversion&gt</kbd> is the desired available ANSYS version to load.
    </p>
  <h3>Licensing</h3>
    <p>ANSYS offered 69 HPC licenses to the universities in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg for scientific research.
      The license server is located in KIT, Karlsruhe, and all the universities in this region are using
      the same licenses under the bwHPC-C5 Project.
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, a cluster user can access up to 69 processors for a single ANSYS job on bwGRiD Cluster. Also,
      ANSYS jobs may fail due to no license availability at the moment if all of the 69 licenses are 
      currently in use by any other user on bwHPC-C5 Clusters. Unfortunately, the information about the 
      license usage is only available to the server administrators in KIT, and any job which will not have 
      a free licence will be aborted with an error and will have to be restarted again later. 
    </p>
