<h1>OpenFOAM on bwGRiD Cluster, Esslingen</h1>
  <h2>Accessing and basic usage</h2>
    <p>To view which OpenFOAM modules are available on the cluster, run the
      following command:
      <pre>$ module avail cae/openfoam</pre>
    </p>
    <p>To load the appropriate version (if available), run:
      <pre>$ module load cae/openfoam/&ltversion&gt</pre>
      where <kbd>&ltversion&gt</kbd> is the desired available OpenFOAM version to load.
    </p>
    <p>After the module is loaded, OpenFOAM needs to be activated by running following:
      <pre>$ source $FOAM_INIT</pre>
    </p>
    <p>or simply:
      <pre>$ foamInit</pre>
    </p>
  <h2>Building an OpenFOAM batch file for parallel processing</h2>
    <p>To run any job in a parallel mode with OpenFOAM, the geometry domain should be decomposed into
      segments, equal to the number of processors you intend to use. That means, for example, a mesh of
      a case which will run on 8 processors, must first be decomposed into 8 segments.
      Then the solver is run in <em>parallel</em> mode, concurrently on these 8 segments, each processor
      responding for one segment of the mesh, sharing the data with all other processors in between. There
      is a built in mechanism which properly connects the generated data on each segment to avoid the
      possible errors.
    </p>
    <p>Mesh decomposition is handled by <kbd>decomposePar</kbd> utility. The number of parts to decompose
      the geometry domain as well as the method to do so is defined in <kbd>system/decomposeParDict</kbd>
      file, in your OpenFOAM case folder.
    </p>
  <h2>OpenFOAM job scripts</h2>
    <p><strong>Attention: </strong><kbd>openfoam</kbd> module loads automatically the necessary
      <kbd>openmpi</kbd> module for parallel run. Do <strong>NOT</strong> load another <kbd>openmpi</kbd>
      version, as it may conflict with the loaded one.
    </p>
    <p>A job script to submit a batch job called <em>job_openfoam.txt</em> that runs the <em>icoFoam</em>
      solver with OpenFOAM version 2.4.0, on 8 processors up to maximum 6 hours looks like:
    </p>
    <p><pre>#!/bin/bash
#number of processors to run a job ncpus=nodes*ppn
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=8:mem24gb

#wall time (up to 24 hours)
#PBS -l walltime=06:00:00

#name of the job
#PBS -N test_icoFoam

#set a log file for job's output
#PBS -o parallelRun.log
#PBS -j oe

#send an e-mail when a job begins, aborts or ends
#PBS -m abe
#e-mail address specification
#PBS -M user@uni.de

#specify the OpenFOAM version and solver to run
OPENFOAM_VERSION="2.4.0"
EXECUTABLE="icoFoam"

#switches to the directory from which 'qsub' command run:
cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR

#load the OpenFOAM module and source it
module load cae/openfoam/$OPENFOAM_VERSION
source $FOAM_INIT

#start the solver
echo "Starting at: "
date

[[ !( -d logs) ]] && mkdir logs -p
