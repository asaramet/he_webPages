      </li>
      <li>You will be redirected to the <em>Identity Provider</em> of your home organisation. (Hochschule 
       Esslingen login site, for example);
      </li>
      <li>Enter your home-organisation user ID/username and your home-organisation password and click 
       the <strong>Login</strong> button;
      </li>

      </p>
    <h3>About User ID / User name</h3>
      <p><kbd><strong>&ltUserID&gt</strong><kbd> of the <kbd>ssh</kbd> command is a placeholder for the 
       <strong>username</strong> at your home organisation with a <strong><em>prefix</em></strong> as
       followed:
       <ul>
        <li> Aalen:         <kbd>&ltUserID&gt = aa_username</kbd></li>
        <li> Esslingen:     <kbd>&ltUserID&gt = es_username</kbd></li>
        <li> Esslingen:     <kbd>&ltUserID&gt = username</kbd>, without any prefix</li>
        <li> Freiburg:      <kbd>&ltUserID&gt = fr_username</kbd></li>
        <li> Heidelberg:      <kbd>&ltUserID&gt = hd_username</kbd></li>
        <li> Hohencheim:      <kbd>&ltUserID&gt = ho_username</kbd></li>
        <li> Karlsruhe:      <kbd>&ltUserID&gt = ka_username</kbd></li>
        <li> Konstanz:      <kbd>&ltUserID&gt = kn_username</kbd></li>
        <li> Mannheim:      <kbd>&ltUserID&gt = ma_username</kbd></li>

        <li> Ulm:      <kbd>&ltUserID&gt = ul_username</kbd></li>
       </ul>
      </p>
    <h3> Allowed activities on the login node (<kbd>grid01</kbd>)</h3>
     <p>The login node on the cluster is the node you are automatically redirected once you login, named 
      <kbd>grid01</kbd>. It is the access point to the compute system and the user's working directories. 
      The login node is shared with all the users of the cluster. Therefore, the activates on this node are 
      limited to the set up of the batch jobs to run. The activities may also be:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>short</strong> compilation of your code;
          <li><strong>short</strong> pre- and post-processing of your batch jobs.
        </ul>
      To guarantee the cluster stability, it is <strong style="color:red">not allowed:</strong> to run 
      compute jobs directly on the login node. Compute jobs must be submitted to the queueing system.
      Any compute job running on the login node, will terminated with any notice. Any long-running compilation
      or any long-running pre or post-processing of batch jobs must also be submitted to the queueing system.
     </p>
<h1>First steps on bwGRiD Esslingen cluster</h1>
  <p>Cluster provides an introduction and user manual that can be accessed from the login node through the
   following command:
   <pre>$ man bw-grid</pre>
   There user can find detailed information about work-spaces, queueing system, compute nodes, etc. 
   Bellow a few basic steps will be described, to start working on the Esslinger bwGRiD cluster.  
  </p>
  <h2>Home directory, workspaces and local scratch disks</h2>
  <p>By default a user's <kbd>$HOME</kbd> directory size is limited to a quota of 100MB. Users can not exceed
   this disk space value and are required to create temporary workspaces for jobs which needs a larger 
   amount of disk space. If for some reason, a project requires a larger amount of disk space in the 
   <kbd>$HOME</kbd> directory, please contact your local grid admin on <kbd>dgrid-support@hs-esslingen.de</kbd>
  </p>
  <p>Command:
   <pre>$ ws_allocate &ltWORKSPACE_NAME&gt &ltPERIOD_OF_EXISTANCE_IN_DAYS&gt</pre>
   allocates a new workspace, where <kbd>&ltWORKSPACE_NAME&gt</kbd> is a name of user's workspace which does 
   not start with "-", and can not contain any special characters or spaces.
   <kbd>&ltPERIOD_OF_EXISTANCE_IN_DAYS&gt</kbd> 
   is the number of days a user want to have the workspace active. Maximum number of days that can be
   allocated is 60. Further, the user can extend the active period of a workspace 16 times, with the 
   following command:
   <pre>$ ws_extend &ltWORKSPACE_NAME&gt</pre>
   To list all your available workspaces and their expiration dates, use:
   <pre>$ ws_list</pre>
   To find allocated directory of a workspace:
   <pre>$ ws_find &ltWORKSPACE_NAME&gt</pre>
  </p>

  <h2>Environment Modules</h2>
  <p>In order to use different compilers, libraries or software packages  on the cluster, users are required 
   to set specific environment variables for each session, which tells the cluster which version or package 
   the user intents to work with. This issue is handled with the help of <strong>Environment modules</strong>
   or short <strong>Modules</strong>. Through some predefined commands, cluster users can load,
   unload, list, read help files of the installed modules on the cluster. 
  </p>
  <p><em>This section will be updated</em>, meanwhile you can visit 
   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bwhpc-c5.de/wiki/index.php/Environment_Modules">bwHPC-C5 wiki modules
    compartment</a>,
   which describes the environment modules usage on HPC clusters in general, and is fully supported on 
   bwGRiD Esslingen as well.
