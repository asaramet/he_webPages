<h2>STAR-CCM+ licensing on bwUniCluster.</h2>
<p>CD-adapco, the company behind STAR-CCM+ offers, cheap or free of charge licenses for academical projects.</p>
<p>These licenses are managed by CD-adapco own license manager and can be used on demand by the user owning a STAR-CCM+ POD-key.</p>
<p>The license server is already connected to bwUniCluster and any user can run jobs pointing the software to it
  (<kbd>flex.cd-adapco.com</kbd>), and the POD-key.</p>
<p>To start a STAR-CCM+ job on bwUniCluster, you'll have to send a
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bwhpc-c5.de/wiki/index.php/Batch_Jobs">batch script</a>,
  to <kbd>msub</kbd> application.
</p>
<h3 style="color:red">Note: All the STAR-CCM+ jobs on the cluster should run only with a POD-key license type!</h3>
<p>As the STAR-CCM+ license server in HE is managing all the licenses in the university, including the ones in the PC-pools,
  you risk to block any STAR-CCM+ calculation made in "house" at the university, as the total number of licenses is limited,
  and using some of them for HPC jobs will put all the other machines at the university in a license queue, waiting for the HPC job to finish.
