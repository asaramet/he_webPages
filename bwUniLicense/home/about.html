<h2>Licenses on bwUniCluster for users from Hochschule Esslingen.</h2>

<p>
  Licenses for commercial software like ANSYS, or STAR-CCM+ for users from Esslingen University of Applied Sciences (HE),
  that a managed by a local license server, are not openly available on platforms other than the university handled ones.
</p>
<p>
  bwUniCluster being a HPC resource platform opened for users from different universities from Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg,
  does not have direct access to the license servers from HE.
</p>
<p>
  Nonetheless, reaching the HE license servers resources is possible through SSH-tunneling.
</p>

<h3>Access and configuration.</h3>
<p>
  A SSH tunnel (also called SSH port forwarding) allows data exchange between bwUniCluster's specific nodes and
  a license server through an intermediate server/PC which has an SSH encrypted connection with bwUniCluster. (See the diagram below)
</p>
<p>In other words, you need a server or PC which can be accessed from bwUniCluster through SSH and is connected to the license server.</p>
<p>For HE users such, a server is <kbd>comserver.hs-esslingen.de</kbd></p>

<p>
  So, in order to create any SSH tunnel from the cluster nodes to the license server you must first ensure that a valid connection exists
  from the bwUniCluster to the com server and it can be passwordless accessed through SSH key authentication.</p>
<h4>Configure SSH key based secure authentication from bwUniCluster to the intermediate (com) server.</h4>
<p>1. Create a SSH public key.</p>
<p>
  If you don't have a SSH public key on bwUniCluster, create one with:
</p>
<p><pre>
  ssh-keygen
</pre></p>
<p>Follow and fill the requested options. At the end you should have the following file created:</p>
<p><pre>
  $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
</pre></p>
<p>2. Authorize SSH key authentication from bwUniCluster to HE comserver.</p>
<p>
  After you created the SSH public key. Run the following command from bwUniCluster:
</p>
<p><pre>
  ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub &ltUSER_ID&gt@&ltCOM_HOSTNAME&gt
</pre></p>
<p>
  where, <kbd>&ltUSER_ID&gt</kbd> is the HE user ID, and <kbd>&ltCOM_HOSTNAME&gt</kbd> is the intermediate server host name.
</p>
<p>
  In our case it is  <kbd>comserver.hs-esslingen.de</kbd>
</p>
<p>
  You'll be asked to provide the HE password for authentication on <kbd>comserver.hs-esslingen.de</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
  To verify if the SSH key based secure authentication have been successfully established, you may run the following command from bwUniCluster:
</p>
<p><pre>
  ssh &ltUSER_ID&gt@&ltCOM_HOSTNAME&gt
</pre></p>
<p>If you get an SSH window of the &ltCOM_HOSTNAME&gt, without being asked for any password, you configured your SSH key based connection successfully. Congratulations.</p>

<h3>Creating a SSH tunnel.</h3>
<p>
  1. Having access to the intermediate server with the host name <kbd>&ltCOM_HOSTNAME&gt</kbd>, user id <kbd>&ltUSER_ID&gt</kbd>
</p>
<p>
  2. Knowing that the intermediate server can connect to the license server with host name <kbd>&ltLCS_HOSTNAME&gt</kbd>, through port <kbd>&ltLCS_PORT&gt</kbd>
</p>
<p>
  It is possible to create an SSH tunnel through a free port <kbd>&ltLOCAL_PORT&gt</kbd>, with the following command:
</p>
<p><pre>
  ssh -MS tunnel-socket -fnNT -L &ltLOCAL_PORT&gt:&ltLCS_HOSTNAME&gt:&ltLCS_PORT&gt &ltUSER_ID&gt@&ltCOM_HOSTNAME&gt
</pre></p>
<p>
  where, <kbd>tunnel-socket</kbd> will be the link to a temporary SSH control socket with the SSH tunnel running in background.
</p>
<p>
  The following command will check the process id of this socket:
</p>
<p><pre>
  ssh -S tunnel-socket -O check &ltUSER_ID&gt@&ltCOM_HOSTNAME&gt
</pre></p>
<p>To close the socket and the tunnel connection with it, do:</p>
<p><pre>
  ssh -S tunnel-socket -O exit &ltUSER_ID&gt@&ltCOM_HOSTNAME&gt
</pre></p>
